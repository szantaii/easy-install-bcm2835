## About

This project simply provides an easy-to-use installer and uninstaller script for [Mike McCauley's bcm2835 C library for the Raspberry Pi](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/).

This project was written to be used on [Raspberry Pi OS (32 or 64 bit)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). It may work on other distributions but it is not guaranteed to do so.

## License

_Please note that this license does not apply to the mentioned bcm2835 C library, it only applies to this repository as it is when you acquired it._

## Prerequisites

* Bash shell.
* `build-essential` metapackage.[^1]
* The following commands to run the installer/uninstaller script:

  | Command        | Software                            |
  |----------------|-------------------------------------|
  | __`dirname`__  | [GNU Coreutils][gnu-coreutils-link] |
  | __`find`__     | [GNU Findutils][gnu-findutils-link] |
  | __`printf`__   | [GNU Coreutils][gnu-coreutils-link] |
  | __`pwd`__      | [GNU Coreutils][gnu-coreutils-link] |
  | __`realpath`__ | [GNU Coreutils][gnu-coreutils-link] |
  | __`tar`__      | [GNU Tar][gnu-tar-link]             |
  | __`wget`__     | [GNU Wget][gnu-wget-link]           |

[gnu-coreutils-link]: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/
[gnu-findutils-link]: https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/
[gnu-tar-link]:       https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/
[gnu-wget-link]:      https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

You can install the necessary packages with the following commands on Raspberry Pi OS:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential coreutils findutils tar wget
```

[^1]: The `build-essential` package is a metapackage. Its required dependencies are installed together with it. It does not install anything by itself. These dependencies, which contain everything required to compile basic software written in C and C++, will be installed when the `build-essential` metapackage is installed.

## Usage

Clone or download this repository and run the following commands to get help, install/uninstall the bcm2835 library, or cleanup the bcm2835 library build directory.

_Please note that some commands need `root` privileges, therefore you will need to run the script either with the `root` user or with a user which is a member of the `sudo` group._

* Get help to use the script:

  ```bash
  ./setup.sh -h
  ```

* Install (download, compile and install) the bcm2835 library:

  ```bash
  ./setup.sh -i
  ```

* Uninstall the bcm2835 library:

  ```bash
  ./setup.sh -u
  ```

* Cleanup the downloaded and compiled bcm2835 library's build directory:

  ```bash
  ./setup.sh -c
  ```

  _If you want to uninstall the bcm2835 library at some point, you will need to keep the contents of the build directory. If you cleanup the build directory, you will not be able to uninstall the library with this script._
